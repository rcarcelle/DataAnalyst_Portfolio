# CIFAR10 Neural Network
This repository contains code for training and evaluating a neural network on the CIFAR10 image dataset using TensorFlow. The goal of this project is to achieve high accuracy in classifying the images in the CIFAR10 dataset.

## Data
The CIFAR10 dataset consists of 50,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes. The classes are: airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, and truck.

The data is included with TensorFlow and can be loaded using the 'cifar10.load_data()' function.

## Libraries
This project uses the following Python libraries:

- TensorFlow: A library for building and training machine learning models.

- Matplotlib: A library for creating visualizations in Python.

- NumPy: A library for numerical computing in Python.

- Time: A library for working with time-related functions.

- Datetime: A library for working with dates and times in Python.

## Setup
To use this code, you will need to install the required libraries. You can install them using pip by running the following command:
```python
pip install tensorflow matplotlib numpy time datetime
````

## Usage
To run the code, you can clone the repository and run the Cifar10_Neural_Network.py file. The file contains code for loading the data, building and training the neural network, and evaluating the accuracy of the model.
