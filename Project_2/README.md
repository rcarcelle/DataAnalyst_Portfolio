# Microsoft Malware Prediction
This repository contains code and data related to the Kaggle competition [Microsoft Malware Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/microsoft-malware-prediction/overview). The competition involves predicting if a machine will soon be hit with malware. I divided the project into three: preprocessing, modeling and prediction.

## Data
The data for the competition can be found on Kaggle. The dataset consists of two files:

- 'malware_traintest.csv': This file contains the train-test data with information on each machine's features and whether it was infected with malware or not.

- 'malware_predict.csv': This file contains data to predict and evaluate the model.

## Libraries
This project uses the following Python libraries:

- **Pandas**: A library for data manipulation and analysis.

- **NumPy**: A library for numerical computing in Python.

- **Matplotlib**: A library for creating visualizations in Python.

- **Seaborn**: A library for data visualization based on Matplotlib.

- **Pickle**: A library for serializing and de-serializing Python objects.

## Setup
To use this code, you will need to install the required libraries. You can install them using pip by running the following command:
```python
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn pickle
````

## Usage
The notebooks contain code for loading the data, exploring the data, and building and evaluating machine learning models.
