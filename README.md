## About Me
👋🏾Hello everyone!👋🏾

I am passionate about cooking 🧑🏾‍🍳, where I have spent the last 5 years perfecting my culinary skills, and about technology; and to add that I have work experience in the retail sector. I have worked in several supermarkets and restaurants, which has given me valuable experience in customer service, managing business operations and, above all, working under pressure 🥵. I love working in teams and finding creative solutions to day-to-day challenges in the retail industry.

In addition, I would like to mention that I have a great facility for languages. I am fluent in several languages, which has allowed me to work in multicultural environments and adapt quickly to different cultures and ways of doing business.

During my master's degree in Data Science I have acquired a wide range of skills and knowledge in the field of data science 🧑🏾‍⚕️. I have learned how to use various data analysis and visualization techniques, Machine Learning and Deep Learning. I have also gained a solid understanding of the mathematical and statistical fundamentals needed to perform rigorous and accurate data analysis.

At the moment, I am looking for new career opportunities in the retail and FMCG sector in the Big Data world 💻 where I can combine my industry experience, passion for technology and language skills to drive business success. 

Additionally, I have learned to work with various tools and technologies used in the data science industry, such as Python, SQL and PowerBI. In Python, I have used libraries such as NumPy, Pandas and Matplotlib for data manipulation, analysis and visualization; and others such as Scikit-learn, TensorFlow and Keras for creating and training machine learning models.

I have developed skills in data cleaning and manipulation, as well as in interpreting results from machine learning models. I have also learned to work in teams on data science projects, using agile methodologies by collaborating with SoGoodData. I have understood the importance of clear and effective communication of data analytics results and findings to different audiences, including managers, clients, and other stakeholders.

I am always eager to learn new tools and techniques and apply them to solve real-world problems. If you have any questions or feedback, feel free to contact me at rcarcelle@gmail.com.😊
